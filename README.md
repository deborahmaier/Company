# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Getting Started with ASP.NET

support the salary admin of a small company. This department has two main responsibilities:
•	Capturing the details of new employees
•	Exporting a csv with the calculated salary of each employee
For the current employees, at least the following information is stored in the database:
•	First name
•	Last name
•	Age 
•	Salary history
The solution should contain logic to calculate the net salary based on the gross salary. Do this based on factors such as working week hours, pension contribution, et cetera


## Data Base

In the database folder, you will find 4 tables, personnel, salary, tax and salary items.
To calculate the net salary the formula is used: gross salary - taxes.

## Web Application

### `Controllers`

You will find the Personnel controller, in which you may found the endpoints to be able to link the back with the front.

### `data`

You will find the staff mapper and the staff interface. 

### `Models`

You will find the respective personnel, salary, salaryItem and tax classes. 

### `utils`

You are going to find the CSV Utility class where you create the csv. The endpoint is not implemented, therefore the download button does not work.
